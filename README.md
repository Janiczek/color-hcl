# Color.Hcl

The [HCL colorspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space) is designed such that when you change the **hue**, the perceived lightness doesn't change.

This package deals with that (conversion from/to RGB and the core `Color` type).

## Example

![Distinct colors for saturation 0.7 and lightness 0.8](https://github.com/Janiczek/distinct-colors/raw/master/doc/colors.png)

These colors have been generated for chroma `70` and luminance `80`.
